# CodeVibeAI Architecture Document

## 1. Introduction

CodeVibeAI is a next-generation coding assistant built on Eclipse Theia that integrates advanced AI capabilities to provide a "vibe coding" experience. This document outlines the system architecture, component interactions, and design considerations for implementing this system.

## 2. System Architecture Overview

CodeVibeAI employs a 5-layer architecture that balances extensibility, performance, and maintainability:

### 2.1 Five-Layer Architecture

1. **Theia Core Layer**
   - Foundation platform providing IDE capabilities
   - Extension mechanisms and UI framework
   - File system, editor, and terminal support
   - Leverages VS Code extensions ecosystem

2. **CodeVibeAI Core Layer**
   - Core services and interfaces
   - Configuration management
   - Extension registry
   - Event bus and messaging system
   - Common utilities and shared types

3. **Integration Layer**
   - Claude API integration for AI capabilities
   - Context7 integration for code understanding
   - Authentication and API key management
   - Request/response handling and caching
   - Rate limiting and error handling

4. **UI Layer**
   - Custom CodeVibeAI-specific UI components
   - AI-powered code actions and suggestions
   - Inline code completion
   - Chat interface for code discussions
   - Context-aware code navigation

5. **Extension System Layer**
   - Plugin API for third-party extensions
   - Extension lifecycle management
   - Extension-specific configuration
   - Integration points for custom AI providers
   - Developer tools for extension creation

## 3. Data Flow Architecture

### 3.1 User Interaction Flow

1. User interacts with CodeVibeAI (edits code, requests assistance)
2. UI Layer captures the interaction and context
3. Request is routed through the Core Layer
4. Integration Layer prepares context and sends to AI services
5. Responses are processed and presented back through the UI Layer

### 3.2 Code Context Flow

1. Context7 continuously analyzes the codebase
2. Context service builds and maintains context models
3. When AI assistance is needed, relevant context is extracted
4. Context is formatted and enriched with specific queries
5. Claude API receives the context and generates intelligent responses

### 3.3 Extension Integration Flow

1. Extensions register capabilities and UI contributions
2. Core layer manages extension lifecycle and configuration
3. Extensions access AI and context services through defined APIs
4. UI components from extensions are integrated into the IDE
5. Extension-specific data is isolated and managed appropriately

## 4. Integration Points

### 4.1 Theia Integration

- Leverages Theia's extension system and dependency injection
- Extends Theia's editor capabilities with AI features
- Adds custom views, commands, and context menus
- Utilizes Theia's workspace management for project context

### 4.2 Claude Code Integration

- Secure API communication with Claude services
- Structured prompting for code generation and analysis
- Response parsing and formatting for IDE presentation
- Telemetry and usage tracking for service optimization
- Caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce API calls

### 4.3 Context7 Integration

- Semantic code analysis and understanding
- Project structure and dependency mapping
- Code graph and relationship modeling
- Language-specific parsing and interpretation
- Context serialization for AI consumption

## 5. API Key Management and Security

### 5.1 Key Storage

- API keys stored securely using OS-specific credential stores
- Keys never stored in plaintext configuration files
- Encryption for keys in transit and at rest
- Key rotation support and expiration management

### 5.2 Access Control

- Permission system for feature access
- Granular control over which extensions can use AI services
- Audit logging for service usage
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### 5.3 Data Privacy

- Local processing of sensitive code when possible
- Configurable data sharing policies
- Anonymization of personal or sensitive information
- Clear user consent for data transmission

## 6. Performance Considerations

### 6.1 Latency Management

- Local caching of AI responses
- Predictive pre-fetching for common operations
- Incremental context updates rather than full rebuilds
- Background processing to minimize UI blocking

### 6.2 Resource Optimization

- Efficient memory usage for context representation
- Lazy loading of extensions and services
- Batched API requests to reduce overhead
- Compression for context data transmission

### 6.3 Scalability

- Microservice architecture for backend services
- Horizontal scaling for high-demand components
- Load balancing for AI service requests
- Stateless design where possible to simplify scaling

## 7. Extension Points

### 7.1 AI Provider Extensions

- Interface for integrating alternative AI services
- Model configuration and selection
- Custom prompt engineering
- Response post-processing

### 7.2 Context Provider Extensions

- Language-specific context providers
- Framework-specific code understanding
- Custom metadata extraction
- Domain-specific context enrichment

### 7.3 UI Extensions

- Custom AI-powered views
- Specialized code analysis visualizations
- Alternative interaction models
- Domain-specific assistants

## 8. Implementation Roadmap

1. Core Layer implementation and Theia integration
2. Basic Claude and Context7 service integration
3. Essential UI components for code assistance
4. Extension API definition and documentation
5. Performance optimization and security hardening
6. Advanced features and specialized extensions

## 9. Conclusion

The CodeVibeAI architecture is designed to create a seamless "vibe coding" experience that leverages the power of AI while maintaining the robustness and extensibility expected in professional development environments. By employing a layered architecture with clear boundaries and well-defined interfaces, the system supports both current requirements and future evolution.
